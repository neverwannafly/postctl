# postctl — work ledger

Append-only. Every agent (and the orchestrator) adds an entry when it **starts**, at each **meaningful milestone**, when **blocked**, and when it **finishes**. Never edit or delete someone else's entry; add a correction entry instead.

## Entry format

## Entries

### 2026-09-29 22:45 IST · Plan · Orchestrator · STARTED
- Did: Read `~/work/prod-console-tui` docs (design-language, tui-stack, plan, AGENTS, README; skipped okta.md as requested). Drafted `docs/plan.md` v0 with architecture, storage proposal, import mapping, script API tiers, workstreams and model assignments.
- Files: `docs/plan.md`, `docs/ledger.md`
- Decisions: Stack mirrors prod-console-tui (Bubble Tea/Bubbles/Lip Gloss/Huh v2); goja proposed as JS runtime (pure Go, no cgo).
- Blockers / questions: 15 open questions sent to user (plan §12).
- Next: Record answers, bump plan to v1, write per-workstream briefs, init git, launch Wave 1 (WS0).

### 2026-09-29 23:00 IST · Plan · Orchestrator · PROGRESS
- Did: Recorded answers to Q1–Q15 in plan §0 and bumped the plan to v1. Inspected the local Postman install: backups are empty and the real data lives in Chromium IndexedDB (LevelDB + V8-serialized values). Added WS1b (local extractor) and WS9 (WebSocket/gRPC).
- Files: `docs/plan.md`, `docs/ledger.md`
- Decisions: WS1b outputs standard v2.1 JSON so the importer (WS1) stays format-stable. Private extracted data goes to gitignored `testdata/private/`.
- Blockers / questions: Round-2 questions (gRPC/OAuth2 depth, launch approval).
- Next: Write briefs for WS0 and WS1b, then launch Wave 1.

### 2026-09-29 23:10 IST · WS0 · Sonnet 5.5 · STARTED
- Branch/worktree: ws/0-scaffold
- Did: Read brief, plan §0, ledger, and reference repo docs/code (design-language, tui-stack, AGENTS, theme, cli, keychain). Confirmed toolchain (Go 1.26.1, task, golangci-lint 2.11.4) and module cache.
- Files: `docs/ledger.md`
- Decisions: none yet.
- Tests: n/a
- Blockers / questions: none
- Next: model types, then store, then scaffold/CLI, theme skeleton, docs.

### 2026-09-29 23:50 IST · WS0 · Sonnet 5.5 · PROGRESS
- Branch/worktree: ws/0-scaffold
- Did: Shipped `internal/model` (Workspace/Collection/Folder/Request/Item tree with ops, URL, KV, Body modes, Auth types incl. OAuth2 grants, Variable/SecretRef/Environment/Globals, Scripts, Settings, Examples, IDs via UUIDv7, Validate) and `internal/store` (Discover/Open/Init, Load, Save/SaveCollection/SaveRequest, env/globals, atomic writes, prune, slug collisions, ordering, SecretStore + MemorySecrets + macOS Keychain via `/usr/bin/security -i`, schema migration hook, local state). Round-trip, golden, secrets-leak, ordering, prune and Keychain tests green (real Keychain test opt-in via `POSTCTL_KEYCHAIN_TESTS=1`, verified once).
- Files: `internal/model/*`, `internal/store/*`, `internal/store/testdata/golden/**`
- Decisions: `Disabled` (not `Enabled`) on KV/Variable/FormPart so zero value = enabled. Nil `*Auth` == inherit. Script `Source` is never in YAML; the store writes sibling `.js` and sets `Script.File` on load. Secret var values and OAuth2 tokens are `yaml:"-"`/cleared and stored under deterministic refs (`env/<id>/<key>`, `oauth2/<ownerID>`, ...). `Load` never reads Keychain; call `Store.Hydrate`. Bulk saves skip fsync (macOS full-fsync of 1000s of files takes seconds); single-file saves fsync.
- Tests: `go test -race ./...` green.
- Blockers / questions: see final report (POSTCTL_HOME semantics, literal credentials in auth fields).
- Next: cmd/postctl, Taskfile, lint config, theme skeleton, docs (model.md, design-language.md, tui-stack.md, AGENTS.md).
